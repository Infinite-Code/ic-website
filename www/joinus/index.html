        No software project is ever like any other. Each time we build software, we build something that is new and unique, otherwise we would just reuse the software that we had previously written. This means that our work is always creative, often collaborative and needs to work right the first time. <span class="text-green">Only the best people can do this reliably and efficiently</span>.

        The first step in getting the best people involves <span class="text-green">hiring the right people</span>. We spend a lot of time searching for and vetting the right candidates. Our interviews are carefully designed to find people who can actually do, not just talk. We also focus on getting the right people that will fit our culture.

      <p>
        Software development is still a relatively young field and we are still trying to figure what works best. We <span class="text-green">believe very strongly in Agile Methodologies.</span> With apologies to Winston Churchill - &ldquo;Agile is the worst form of software development except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time&rdquo;.
      </p>
      <p>
        Agile allows us to quickly deliver features to our clients, letting them see progress from the beginning. Its process also allows us to rapidly adapt to changing markets and environments. All this, while allowing our teams <span class="text-green">autonomy, growth and pride</span> in their work at the same time.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 joinus3-row2">
      No process is perfect, but Agile allows each team to own and evolve the process to something that uniquely suits them. As a software developer in an agile team:

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-md-2 col-sm-offset-0 col-md-offset-1 joinus3-cell joinus3-cell1 txt">
      You spend less time reading and writing big documents
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-md-2 joinus3-cell joinus3-cell2 txt">
      You spend much more time writing code and delivering value
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-md-2 joinus3-cell joinus3-cell3 txt">
      You work with a team, always having someone you can bounce ideas off, ask for help or learn from

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-md-2 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-offset-0 joinus3-cell joinus3-cell4 txt">

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 joinus4-row1">
      We believe the future lies in developing software collaboratively, openly and globally. No other movement embodies these principles better than the Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) movement.
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 joinus4-row2">
      Where possible, we use software created by this movement because:
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-2 col-md-offset-2 joinus4-cell joinus4-cell1">
      It can be freely customised to fit our needs
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-2 joinus4-cell joinus4-cell2">
      Typically gives us much greater flexibility in scaling, deployment and configuration
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-2 joinus4-cell joinus4-cell3">
      Is much easier to profile, debug and fix than most closed source, proprietary software
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-2 joinus4-cell joinus4-cell4">
      Is typically of higher quality, robustness and security
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 joinus4-row3">
      That said, we understand there are situations where certain FOSS solutions are not the best candidate and choose accordingly. Need to keep the code private for competitive reasons? We pick the FOSS solutions/licenses that allow this. Is this a non-core section that provides no competitive advantage? Then we select the solutions that allow us to benefit from a global community of feature development and bug fixes.
